There are very few things that require policies, usually common sense is enough. Security does require a policy, because not everybody is a security expert and the company security is only as good as it's weakest link.

Most of Wunderkrautâ€™s work is performed online, an environment that is vulnerable to attacks. We operate in environments that require us to handle, store and transmit personal and sensitive data.

**Our customers must be able to trust us with their confidential information.** Many of our clients insist on our implementation and proper management of information security policies and procedures.

### Security Policy Scope

The goal of our security policy is to be as simple as possible, not to block people from working, but still be effective.

The policy is applicable to, and will be communicated to, all staff within the Wunder/Wunderkraut group. In order for it to be effective it must be followed by anyone with a wunderkraut.com email address and who therefore has access to and interacts with company and client data in all its forms. This includes systems and data attached to our internal network, public and private networks.

Our transparency and open-data-access practises make this a requirement.

## 5 Simple Steps of Wunderkraut Security

### 1. No automatic logins

Disable automatic login on your laptop. Enable code or password login on your phone and your tablet. When the device is not being used it should automatically lock itself. Anyone who gets access to a device has access to all of your files.

### 2. Encrypt your devices

If a device is stolen or misplaced we don't want to lose the files as well. Combining password access to a device with local encryption ensures this.

If a device does not support encryption it should not be used to store work files. This includes computers, phones, tablets, external hard drives and memory sticks.

### 3. Remote wipe enabled if supported
If a device supports remote wipe that should be enabled. This is especially important for devices like mobile phones with four digit passwords or other weak passwords that are easily cracked.

### 4. Unique, long, random passwords for web sites
Sites are hacked all the time, passwords stolen and simple passwords cracked. The only way to be secure is to use long, random passwords that are unique for each site. Never reuse a password between multiple sites. This is a vital way we can keep our customer sites secure.

### 5. Local computer firewall, VPN
We often work in unprotected networks, like open WiFi. When you do, it's important to enable the firewall on your computer. We highly recommend you use a VPN when you are even the slightest bit uncertain of security on the network you are using.
